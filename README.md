For this, I have created a fully functional web application using the Angular framework. The goal was to build a basic web UI frontend for the REST API developed in https://github.com/MunwarAli12/model-java_REST-API_web_application-. Angular is a well-known and powerful front-end programming platform that enables developers to easily build dynamic web applications.

The web UI frontend application was developed using Angular 13 framework, integrating with Springboot REST API to interact with a MongoDB database. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations such as adding servers, deleting servers, and searching for servers by name.

The technologies used to build this application include Angular framework, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. Overall, this application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the REST API and managing server objects in the MongoDB database.
